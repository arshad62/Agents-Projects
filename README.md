## Introduction

The **Agents_Project** is an AI-focused repository that provides implementations of intelligent agents capable of performing autonomous tasks. It is designed for researchers, developers, and students who are interested in:

- Understanding agent-based systems.
- Building problem-specific intelligent agents.
- Learning AI concepts like Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Multi-Agent Systems.

## Features

- **Single-Agent Systems**: Implement agents for standalone problem-solving scenarios.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Simulate environments with multiple agents interacting or competing.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilize techniques like Q-learning and Deep Q-Learning.
- **Customizable Environments**: Define custom environments for agents to operate in.
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphical representation of agent actions and environment changes.
